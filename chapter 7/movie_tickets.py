# A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age.
# If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between
#  3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is
# $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the 
# cost of their movie ticket.
