# Write a test file for Employee with two test functions, test_give_default
# _raise() and test_give_custom_raise(). Write your tests once without using a
# fixture, and make sure they both pass. Then write a fixture so you donâ€™t
# have to create a new employee instance in each test function. Run the tests
# again, and make sure both tests still pass
