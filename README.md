## 🔍 Overview

This repository includes simple and effective Python scripts that are useful for learners, educators, and developers. The aim is to demonstrate how Python can be used to solve real-world problems with short, readable code.

---

## 🧠 What's Inside

- 📐 **Basic Utilities**: Mathematical calculators, string operations, sorting methods, etc.
- 🔁 **Automation Scripts**: Repetitive task automation using loops and conditions
- 🎯 **Practice Projects**: Code samples designed to improve logic-building skills
- 🧪 **Testing Demos**: Examples that show how to write and use test cases (Pytest)

All scripts are self-contained and beginner-friendly. You can run them without any setup other than Python.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FuryLusifer/short-python-programs.git
cd short-python-programs
```

Run a script:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

## 📁 Example Scripts

- `calculator.py`: Performs basic arithmetic
- `is_palindrome.py`: Checks if a word or phrase is a palindrome
- `file_reader.py`: Reads and prints file contents
- `guess_number.py`: A simple number guessing game

> More scripts are added regularly. Explore them in the main directory.

## 🧪 Testing Scripts

To run test scripts using Pytest:

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest
```

Tests (if available) will be located alongside the scripts they validate.
